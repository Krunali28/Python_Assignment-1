Assignment Part-1

Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?
A1. In computer software, a general-purpose programming language (GPL) is a programming language designed 
to be used for building software in a wide variety of application domains, 
across a multitude of hardware configurations and operating systems.Now any programming language that enables development of a program 
in a much more user-friendly programming context and is generally independent of the computer's hardware architecture.
Because they are not written in machine-readable language, 
Python programs need to be processed before machines can run them. 
Python is an interpreted language. This means that every time a program is run, 
its interpreter runs through the code and translates it into machine-readable byte code.

Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?
A2.Python don't have any problem even if we don't declare the type of variable. It states the kind of variable in the runtime of the program. 
Python also take cares of the memory management which is crucial in programming. So, Python is a dynamically typed language.

Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?
A3.Pros:1.Easy to use,read,write and learn
	2.Interpreted language
	3.Dynamically typed
	4.Python is free to use and distribute. It is open source.
	5.Extensive support for libraries– Python has vast libraries that contain almost any function needed. 
	It also further provides the facility to import other packages using Python Package Manager(pip).
	6.Portable– Python programs can run on any platform without requiring any change.
	7.The data structures used in python are user friendly.
	8.It provides more functionality with less coding.
   Cons:1.Issues with Design
	2.Slower than Compiled Languages
	3.Security
	4.Work Environment
	5.Python’s Memory Consumption and Garbage Collection
	6.Python is Dynamically Typed
	7.Multithreading in Python

Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?
A4. Artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning.

Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?
A5. variables are used to store any value at some location.
	Declaring variables are like... 
	e.g.    a=5
		b=7
	or	a,b=5,7
	or	a=5; b=7

Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?
A6.  input (): This function first takes the input from the user and converts it into a string.

Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?
A7. String

Q8. What is type casting?
A8. 

Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?
A9. Split( ) function helps us get multiple inputs from the user and assign them to the respective variables in one line. 
	Syntax : variable 1, variable 2 = input("Enter what has to be conveyed to the user here"). split() # for space-separated inputs
	e.g.   l, b = input("Enter length and width: ").split() 
	print("Length of rectangle: ", l) 
	print("Width of rectangle: ", b) 


	Output:
	Enter length and width: 15 12
﻿	Length of rectangle: 15
	Width of rectangle: 12

Q10. What are keywords?
A10. Keywords are some predefined and reserved words in python that have special meanings. Keywords are used to define the syntax of the coding.

Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.
A11. Keywords are used to define the syntax of the coding. The keyword cannot be used as an identifier, function, and variable name. 
     All the keywords in python are written in lower case except True and False.

Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?
A12. Python indentation refers to adding white space before a statement to a particular block of code.

Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?
A13. The basic way to do output is the print statement.

Q14. What are operators in Python?
A14. Python divides the operators in the following groups:
	Arithmetic operators
	Assignment operators
	Comparison operators
	Logical operators
	Identity operators
	Membership operators
	Bitwise operators

Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?
A15. / is for Division
     // is for floor division

Q16. Write a code that gives following as an output.
iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron
A16. a="iNeuron"
     print(a+a+a+a)
output: iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron

Q17. Write a code to take a number as an input from the user and check if the number is odd or even.
A17. 
n=int(input("Enter the number to check odd or even number:"))
if n%2==0:
    print("Even number")
else:
    print('Odd number')

Q18. What are boolean operator?
A18. Ture,Flase

Q19. What will the output of the following?

1 or 0

0 and 0

True and False and True

1 or 0 or 0


Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?
A20. The following are the conditional statements provided by Python.
	if.
	if..else.
	Nested if.
	if-elif statements.

Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?
A21. The if / elif / else structure is a common way to control the flow of a program, 
     allowing you to execute specific blocks of code depending on the value of some data.

Q22. Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". If age is < 18 display "I can't vote".
A22. 

n1=int(input("Enter your age:"))
if n1>=18:
    print("I can vote")
else:
    print("I can't vote")

Q23. Write a code that displays the sum of all the even numbers from the given list.
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
A23. 

list1=[12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
even=[]
odd=[]
for number in list1:
    if number%2==0:
        even.append(number)
    else:
        odd.append(number)
print("Sum of even numbers in the list: ",sum(even))


Q24. Write a code to take 3 numbers as an input from the user and display the greatest no as output.
A24. 

number1=input("Enter first number :")
number2=input("Enter second number :")
number3=input("Enter third number :")
maximum=max(number1,number2,number3)

print("Greatest no is:", maximum)

Q25. Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions

The number must be divisible by five

If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number

If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop

A25.
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
A25.
list01=[12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
n01=[]
n02=[]
for number in list01:
    if number%5==0 and number<150:
        n01.append(number)
    elif number>500:
        break
print("numbers of this list:", n01)
